# Lunar Modules

Modules for the Lua programming language

## What is Lunar Modules?

There have been many discussion in the past within the Lua community on how to deal with abandoned projects. For this purpose we have created the Github organization “Lunar Modules”.

This organization is **NOT** about maintaining, but about governance. Essentially the team will manage the organization and add projects/teams/people for specific repositories, but the team will not do any maintenance work like fixing bugs, merging pr’s or pushing releases (though on occasions they might).

## Why Lunar Modules?
Because sometimes projects get lost, maintainers lack time, and forking and moving links all over the place is cumbersome. The governance of an organization like Lunar Modules is light-weight and should be easy to maintain. This allows us to keep cornerstone libraries a float, even if they go unmaintained for a while.

## Why not use the old Kepler project or the LuaRocks org?
The Kepler Project had some issues with copyrights, which were Keplers, but it was not a legal entity despite presenting itself like one. As for LuaRocks; many projects landed there for the lack of a better alternative, but this is not the right place, as [explicitly stated](http://lua-users.org/lists/lua-l/2021-04/msg00025.html) by it's lead maintainer.
